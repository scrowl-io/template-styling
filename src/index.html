          <p>Respect in the workplace is a fundamental human right. All employees—regardless of their differences—deserve to be treated with dignity and fairness. Building a culture of respect leads to a more successful and enjoyable work experience for everyone.</p>
          <p>Respectful workplaces are free of inequality, harassment, and discrimination. They're inclusive and promote strong relationships. And they foster healthy communication, engagement, and productivity.</p>
          <p>But despite the benefits, building a respectful workplace isn't always easy. We might get caught up in our day-to-day operations and unintentionally disregard others. We might focus too intently on what we want, and forget to consider how our words and actions impact others. So, how can we combat those roadblocks and build a respectful workplace?</p>
