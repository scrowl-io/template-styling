          <p>The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA) became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the government of Ontario developed mandatory accessibility standards that organizations must follow to become more accessible. The goal for the province is to be fully accessible by 2025. All levels of government, private sectors, and non-profits must comply.</p>
          <p>The purpose of the AODA is to develop, implement, and enforce accessibility standards, so that all Ontarians will benefit from accessible services, programs, and employment.</p>

          <h1>Why do we need AODA Training</h1>
          <p>AODA training gives employees basic knowledge about accessibility and how it impacts people with disabilities. We often think of disabilities as either physical or visible. However, AODA includes all disabilities: physical, visible, and invisible disabilities, such as learning and mental health disabilities.</p>
